    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>
        OpenXiino is an open-source replacement for the Xiino Data Server. The primary purpose of OpenXiino is to encode
        images in the proprietary "EBDIMAGE" format. It will also (unintentionally) downgrade HTTPS requests to HTTP,
        mitigating the fact that Xiino's TLS stack is at least 20 years old and incompatible with the modern web.

        I created OpenXiino in my spare time as a passion project. The EBDIMAGE format has intrigued me for over two
        years,
        and I'm glad to finally understand its intricacies.

        I'd also like to give a shoutout to dmitrygr for pointers regarding Palm OS image formats and their
        compression, and to my many other good friends on the Internet for their general help and support.

        Finally, a big thanks to Kazuho Oku and everyone at ILINX and Mobirus for creating Palmscape and Xiino back in
        the day. Without your work, we wouldn't be here.
