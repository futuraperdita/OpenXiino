# OpenXiino

An open-source replacement for the data server required by the Palm OS browser "Xiino".

Converts images from any format supported by Pillow to Xiino's proprietary format, and reduces HTML to only tags supported by Xiino. (`SCRIPT` tags are not included, as modern Javascript far exceeds the capabilities of Xiino.)

## Setup

1. You will need to have TCP/IP configured on your Palm OS device.
   - For devices with Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, see the [PalmDB guide](https://palmdb.net/help/internet-connect).
   - For older devices that lack wireless connectivity, I recommend [Softick PPP](https://palmdb.net/app/softick-ppp). This will require a USB or serial connection.
   - Other methods of connecting to the internet - such as through a GSM mobile phone - will work, as long as the dataserver host is reachable.
2. Install the requirements from `requirements.txt`. (`pip -r requirements.txt`).
   - You will need to use the latest version of Python3 - OpenXiino will not run under Python 3.9 or earlier.
3. Run the server. (`python dataserver.py`)  
   The server will run on port 4040 - this cannot be changed at this time
4. If you haven't already, install [Xiino](https://palmdb.net/app/xiino) on your Palm OS device.
5. Press Menu on your Palm OS device. Go to Options > Prefs, and scroll down to "DataServer" (or similar). On v3.4.1, this is on Page 3. On all versions I have tested, the default is `pds.mobirus.com` or `pds.ilinx.com`.
6. Change "DataServer" to `[ip]:4040`. For instance, if the DataServer host uses the IP address `192.168.1.5`, set the DataServer to `192.168.1.5:4040`. Click OK to close Prefs.
7. To test OpenXiino is working correctly, tap "Select", then tap "URL...". Enter `http://about/` as the URL. You should see a page with the OpenXiino logo.
